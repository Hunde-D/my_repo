# Star Airline
A virtual ticket purchasing system built with c++.


```c++
compile the all the three files
main.cpp
contains the main function
func.cpp
contains all function bodies. We used the extern keyword to fetch variables from the main module.
header.h
header file containing function prototypes.
```
### Functions
```
void menu();
void profile();
 void printTicket(int seat_num,int classPrice );
 unsigned int price(int flightClassRow);
  void int_seats(char array[SEATS],int elements);
  void seat_map(char seats[SEATS]);
  unsigned int count_seats(char seats[SEATS]);
  unsigned int count_first_class(char seats[30]);


```
## Usage

```
Compile/build the files and then run the executable generated.
(use GCC if you are on a Linux machine, use code::blocks if on windows.)

-Once the executable is running, it displays the console for Input and Output
```
## Description
```
-First, the user is asked whether he/she wants to buy a ticket or not.
-Then, the user is prompted to enter basic personal
 information while invoking the profile() information
- After that, the user is asked to enter the seat number the user intends to get 
ticketed. The range is 1-30 for first-class seats and 31-100 for economy class.
- The user is redirected back to this point if the seat number entered by the user
and the class of that seat is already full. 
For instance, if the user enters 5 while the first class is already full.
- Then the ticket is printed and the loop continues.
